# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: Write a blog project
This is the Write a data science blog project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

The blog post can be found here: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

## Project Overview :
I have decided to use the publically available Airbnb data for London. This is quite a large dataset, so I have focused around the location metrics for this project.

## Problem Statement :
I set out to answer the following questions:

1 - What is the geographic distribution of Airbnb properties in London?

2 - How far are properties from the centre of London?
 
3 - How does price differ with distance from the Centre of London?

4 - How does availability differ with distance from the Centre of London?

5 - How do amenities change with distance from the Centre of London?


## Packages Used
In order to run the project notebook python 3 needs to be installed and the following packages:

- pandas
- geopandas
- shapely
- plotly
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## File Structure
